            "intro": "MADA is one of Montreal’s most important anti-poverty organizations, and one of MacLean’s top 100 Canadian charities. In 2021 they set out to raise $2 million dollars through a major public fundraising campaign. We worked with them to craft a creative strategy, messaging, and visual language that would ask donors to consider the impossible choices and diverse needs of MADA’s clients. We did this drive donations and inspire fundraising teams to take action. The campaign was a success—raising $2 million dollars in 7 days.",
            "challenge": "MADA had more ambitious goals than ever. They wanted to double last year’s success while telling a complex story about changing social circumstances, the future of the organization, and the needs that were going to be exposed as emergency funding from the pandemic tapered off in the community. The previous year’s campaign used a very strong, simple, COVID-19 relief focused message to drive unprecedented levels of donor-engagement. We had our work cut out for us.",
            "dotstrip": "Raise $2m with a story about changing realities in the community.",
            "approach": "After a couple weeks of researching and engaging with the MADA team—we came back with a core thrust for the campaign: “Could You Choose”. A ton of people who access food banks, and other similar services, skip out on meals to afford other basic necessities on the regular. We thought this was a deeply human reality that donors would connect to. It also provided space for us to talk about the diverse range of community services that MADA provides. As a second prong in the campaign, we focused on the idea of “hope” and how to nurture it. MADA makes sure that people aren’t just fed, but that they’re nourished. That they have access to community, security, and dignity. With “I Need Hope” we pushed the message that those things, not just food, were the foundation for hope.",
            "execution": "We executed the campaign through a mix of digital and traditional media: social posts, placement ads, print, billboards, in-city signs, TV commercials, email, and donor-letters. The goal was to make the messaging inescapable to anyone who was likely to be a donor to MADA—whether that was online or IRL. Once we established the core messaging, we focused on three stories: the story of a young mother, an older couple, and a young man. We booked time to with them to for a video and photo shoot. This would serve as the essential material for our placement ads, print, and video campaign.",
            "outcome": "The campaign was a success on several fronts. Of course the most important metric, funds raised, speaks for itself. Within 7 days the campaign raised $2 million. Digital ad spending on our creative assets proved useful—showing a 6x ROI on ad dollars spent (with “Could You Choose” being the highest performer of our assets”. Finally, the message was successful in mobilizing the existing community: 129 fundraising teams raised an average of $10,000 each—for a total of $1.4 million."

We looked at healthcare, tech, and the social sector as a starting point. Then, we built a brand values compass and mooodboards—helping the client understand what similar brands were doing, and where Smart Hospital could fit into the picture. Then, we moved onto developing 3 logo options for the team to vote on. All of them were debated—but one eventually rose to the top. Finally, the team chose a colour palette that felt warm and kind—and the project was finished.",
            "execution": "Once the brand direction was landed on, we asked the Smart Hospital team what kind of assets they might need. We sent them a simple 20-page style guide for their team to use, a couple key assets so that they could get their social media up and running, and finally gave them assets for use across the hospital.",

Because they didn’t just need to convince the haters to get on their side—they needed to mobilize a significant percentage of the student population to meet quorum. Our approach? A world-saving donut shop.",

We used the donut shop as a means of explaining the benefits (and impact) of the collective economy. We thought it was an interesting, provocative, and funny way to pack a ton of complex information into a 90-second video.",
            "execution": "We imagined the script and visual style as an homage to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Wes Anderson. Once we had those approved by the team, we connected to a local donut shop and filmed for a day. With that footage we built out four videos.",

We re-imagined the pages—bringing in new visual motifs and developing an interactive map to help people navigate local RISE projects. View the RISE page here. View the VOTE page here.",
            "challenge": "The challenge was mobilizing young voters in a way that was national and non-partisan way. We had to strike a conversational tone that young people would see themselves in—and actually follow the story to the resources or application at the bottom. We had to do this in a nonpartisan way that would activate people across localities and the political spectrum.",
            "dotstrip": "Mobilize young voters in a way that was national and non-partisan.",
            "approach": "To address these challenges, we developed two major design innovations. The first one was an interactive map that allowed people to see their city, the projects within, and the people connected to those projects. We thought this was a better way to engage people across Canada—and organize the information that was previously broken down as a long list. The second was to mimic the UX of iMessage. We structured the content as a text conversation about voting. Then, we brought that to life on the page. To tie it all together, we added new illustrative elements and refined the UX of each page.",
            "execution": "We started with a couple brainstorm sessions, moved through to content design, mocked the site up in Figma, and then developed it as custom code on Nation Builder. The writing and design of the site was relatively straightforward. We wanted to pull on AisB’s existing messaging and brand principles—but take them to the next level visually. We did that by crafting an outside the box VOTE narrative that was built on their existing messaging framework. We also integrated illustrations into their existing photos—to really add a touch of wonder to their human imagery. The execution of the interactive (and editable) map was a complex development challenge within the NationBuilder CRM. We built it out seamlessly after research and some good old fashioned hard work.",
            "outcome": "We launched the pages! In the case of VOTE, we did it just in time for the writ to drop. As Apathy is Boring ramped up their activities ahead of the 2021 Federal Election—our pages became a hub for a ton of traffic that their initiatives were sending to the website. In the case of the outcome for these pages, though, pictures speak louder than words."

            "approach": "We started with a survey—asking more than 100 young people what their relationship is to charitable giving. We took this data, and more detailed research, to develop our brand strategy. This took the form of a strategic Narrative and Experience Principles—which defined the brand’s audience, market positioning, key values, and it’s &quot;pitch story&quot;. Once that was done, we worked to develop a visual brand and website that reflected our strategic objectives. Finally, with all of this research and brand strategy done—we developed a brand Go-To-Market campaign which went out through social media, direct outreach, and digital advertising.",
            "execution": "Our principle for this brand campaign was experimentation. Experiment with different approaches to messaging, content, and audience targeting so that we could learn as much as possible about the audience + what would get them to convert. So, we tried several different content approaches: a 2-minute animated video, 1-minute &quot;Explainer&quot; videos, a couple animated GIFs, and static infographic content for social media. We took feedback from our audience as we rolled these pieces out—adjusting our focus, and creative asset, up until we surpassed our established social media followership growth goals for the initial brand campaign.",
            "outcome": "Our brand strategy work was a game-changer for the product—identifying the audience, market opportunity, and key strategic narrative to tell in order to break into the market. This has been used to great success to acquire speaking opportunities, coverage, and interest from our user base. <br/><br/>The Infāque social media accounts were starting from scratch—so we set reasonable initial goals: 300 followers within the first couple weeks. During the initial two weeks of the brand campaign we received 60,000 impressions and surpassed our follower goal by 200 across platforms. Most importantly, we gathered important data about user preferences through very limited spending—Infāque can use it to shape their decisions when they’re ready to go to market at scale."
