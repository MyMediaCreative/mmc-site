            "intro": "MADA is one of Montreal’s most important anti-poverty organizations, and one of MacLean’s top 100 Canadian charities. In 2021 they set out to raise $2 million dollars through a major public fundraising campaign. We worked with them to craft a creative strategy, messaging, and visual language that would ask donors to consider the impossible choices and diverse needs of MADA’s clients. We did this drive donations and inspire fundraising teams to take action. The campaign was a success—raising $2 million dollars in 7 days.",
            "challenge": "MADA had more ambitious goals than ever. They wanted to double last year’s success while telling a complex story about changing social circumstances, the future of the organization, and the needs that were going to be exposed as emergency funding from the pandemic tapered off in the community. The previous year’s campaign used a very strong, simple, COVID-19 relief focused message to drive unprecedented levels of donor-engagement. We had our work cut out for us.",
            "dotstrip": "Raise $2m with a story about changing realities in the community.",
            "approach": "After a couple weeks of researching and engaging with the MADA team—we came back with a core thrust for the campaign: “Could You Choose”. A ton of people who access food banks, and other similar services, skip out on meals to afford other basic necessities on the regular. We thought this was a deeply human reality that donors would connect to. It also provided space for us to talk about the diverse range of community services that MADA provides. As a second prong in the campaign, we focused on the idea of “hope” and how to nurture it. MADA makes sure that people aren’t just fed, but that they’re nourished. That they have access to community, security, and dignity. With “I Need Hope” we pushed the message that those things, not just food, were the foundation for hope.",
            "execution": "We executed the campaign through a mix of digital and traditional media: social posts, placement ads, print, billboards, in-city signs, TV commercials, email, and donor-letters. The goal was to make the messaging inescapable to anyone who was likely to be a donor to MADA—whether that was online or IRL. Once we established the core messaging, we focused on three stories: the story of a young mother, an older couple, and a young man. We booked time to with them to for a video and photo shoot. This would serve as the essential material for our placement ads, print, and video campaign.",
            "outcome": "The campaign was a success on several fronts. Of course the most important metric, funds raised, speaks for itself. Within 7 days the campaign raised $2 million. Digital ad spending on our creative assets proved useful—showing a 6x ROI on ad dollars spent (with “Could You Choose” being the highest performer of our assets”. Finally, the message was successful in mobilizing the existing community: 129 fundraising teams raised an average of $10,000 each—for a total of $1.4 million."

We looked at healthcare, tech, and the social sector as a starting point. Then, we built a brand values compass and mooodboards—helping the client understand what similar brands were doing, and where Smart Hospital could fit into the picture. Then, we moved onto developing 3 logo options for the team to vote on. All of them were debated—but one eventually rose to the top. Finally, the team chose a colour palette that felt warm and kind—and the project was finished.",
            "execution": "Once the brand direction was landed on, we asked the Smart Hospital team what kind of assets they might need. We sent them a simple 20-page style guide for their team to use, a couple key assets so that they could get their social media up and running, and finally gave them assets for use across the hospital.",

Because they didn’t just need to convince the haters to get on their side—they needed to mobilize a significant percentage of the student population to meet quorum. Our approach? A world-saving donut shop.",

We used the donut shop as a means of explaining the benefits (and impact) of the collective economy. We thought it was an interesting, provocative, and funny way to pack a ton of complex information into a 90-second video.",
            "execution": "We imagined the script and visual style as an homage to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Wes Anderson. Once we had those approved by the team, we connected to a local donut shop and filmed for a day. With that footage we built out four videos.",

We re-imagined the pages—bringing in new visual motifs and developing an interactive map to help people navigate local RISE projects. View the RISE page here. View the VOTE page here.",
            "challenge": "The challenge was mobilizing young voters in a way that was national and non-partisan way. We had to strike a conversational tone that young people would see themselves in—and actually follow the story to the resources or application at the bottom. We had to do this in a nonpartisan way that would activate people across localities and the political spectrum.",
            "dotstrip": "Mobilize young voters in a way that was national and non-partisan.",
            "approach": "To address these challenges, we developed two major design innovations. The first one was an interactive map that allowed people to see their city, the projects within, and the people connected to those projects. We thought this was a better way to engage people across Canada—and organize the information that was previously broken down as a long list. The second was to mimic the UX of iMessage. We structured the content as a text conversation about voting. Then, we brought that to life on the page. To tie it all together, we added new illustrative elements and refined the UX of each page.",
            "execution": "We started with a couple brainstorm sessions, moved through to content design, mocked the site up in Figma, and then developed it as custom code on Nation Builder. The writing and design of the site was relatively straightforward. We wanted to pull on AisB’s existing messaging and brand principles—but take them to the next level visually. We did that by crafting an outside the box VOTE narrative that was built on their existing messaging framework. We also integrated illustrations into their existing photos—to really add a touch of wonder to their human imagery. The execution of the interactive (and editable) map was a complex development challenge within the NationBuilder CRM. We built it out seamlessly after research and some good old fashioned hard work.",
            "outcome": "We launched the pages! In the case of VOTE, we did it just in time for the writ to drop. As Apathy is Boring ramped up their activities ahead of the 2021 Federal Election—our pages became a hub for a ton of traffic that their initiatives were sending to the website. In the case of the outcome for these pages, though, pictures speak louder than words."

We positioned CHASM as an organization giving entrepreneurs the tools they need to thrive in this cultural context, and create more impact for communities.

This took the form of a strategic Narrative and Experience Principles—which defined the brand’s audience, market positioning, key values, and it’s &quot;pitch story&quot;. Once that was done, we worked to develop a visual brand and website that reflected our strategic objectives. Finally, with all of this research and brand strategy done—we developed a brand Go-To-Market campaign which went out through social media, direct outreach, and digital advertising.",
            "execution": "Our principle for this brand campaign was experimentation. Experiment with different approaches to messaging, content, and audience targeting so that we could learn as much as possible about the audience + what would get them to convert. So, we tried several different content approaches: a 2-minute animated video, 1-minute &quot;Explainer&quot; videos, a couple animated GIFs, and static infographic content for social media. We took feedback from our audience as we rolled these pieces out—adjusting our focus, and creative asset, up until we surpassed our established social media followership growth goals for the initial brand campaign.",
            "outcome": "Our brand strategy work was a game-changer for the product—identifying the audience, market opportunity, and key strategic narrative to tell in order to break into the market. This has been used to great success to acquire speaking opportunities, coverage, and interest from our user base. <br/><br/>The Infāque social media accounts were starting from scratch—so we set reasonable initial goals: 300 followers within the first couple weeks. During the initial two weeks of the brand campaign we received 60,000 impressions and surpassed our follower goal by 200 across platforms. Most importantly, we gathered important data about user preferences through very limited spending—Infāque can use it to shape their decisions when they’re ready to go to market at scale."

Based on a model developed in the UK, Participatory Canada was developing innovative ways to build community at the neighbourhood level—through shared spaces + projects. Despite being at the height of the COVID pandemic, and not having any on-the-ground footage to use, we collected phone photos and Zoom interviews—setting out to make a video that shared learnings from Participatory Canada’s first year in operations.",

Our job was to pull all of these disparate elements together into a beautiful collage that shared the valuable lessons that McConnell had learned about community-building and reconciliation with funders and other stakeholders.",

Going in, we begun to realize that we were going to need to rely heavily on animation. We planned out several animations—and discovered tool for animating maps. Given the theme of the video (urban social innovation) we thought this was perfect. On top of that, we interviewed a couple program directors at the local leve to narrate the story. Finally, we animated some of the phone photos, pulled it together, and made a beautiful testament to local community resilience during the pandemic.",

            "intro": "Christian Ventura, owner and chef behind Sushi MoMo and Casa Kaizen, approached us with his new brand: NoFish. The brand was focused on being a quick, vegan, alternative to fish-based sushi for young Montrealers. We leaned into those brand principles for the campaign: Easy, Vegan, Delicious. It was simple—just like dinner should be. On top of that, we imagined a local QR-code based scavenger hunt called the “Golden Roll” which would activate people locally and on social media to get free sushi in exchange for shares.",
            "challenge": "Launch a new sushi brand in the pandemic. Cultivate brand loyalty to a casual sushi restaurant. Challenge existing beliefs about the quality and taste of vegan sushi alternatives. Create a high quality sushi brand that didn’t need to be eaten on a night out—but could be ordered at lunch, on a lazy evening, and in sweatpants. Use these to differentiate NoFish from Christian Ventura’s other brands.",
            "dotstrip": "Cultivate local brand loyalty for a casual vegan sushi project.",
            "approach": "Our approach was two-fold. One was a digital campaign—leveraging ad spending and organic growth tactics to cultivate a following on social media. For this, we focused on a simple set of value propositionbased messages: Easy. Vegan. Delicious. We also focused on building interest around NoFish’s unique brand voice. We did this to appeal to young sushi-eaters who wanted something casual, funny, and approachable in the Montreal market. The second approach was through a local campaign: “The Golden Roll”, which created a QR-code based scavenger hunt for people to engage in and share—in exchange for the chance at winning free sushi.",
            "execution": "For the digital campaign, we built out some messages that really reinforced the brand messages. The first were our “Easy. Vegan. Delicious.” GIFs. These simple, eye-catching GIFs quickly set the tone for NoFish’s brand + got the value propositions out there quickly. The second set of ads were more playful, and irreverent—catching people’s attention with bold copy and slick design. We extended this brand campaign through to the packaging of the box—which we built for launch, and included games that you could play on the back. Finally, we built out a strategy and assets for our “Golden Roll” scavenger hunt.",
            "outcome": "The launch of NoFish was a success on social media! NoFish’ Instagram grew 120% in just a couple weeks—from 474 followers to 1046. The brand was included in several media outlets after its launch—and the feedback from people who ordered it was great!"

IPPNWC reached out to us to run a campaign that would draw medical students (among other young people) into their mentorship programs. The goal was to spread a 21st century message that could help the organization find the next generation of peace advocates. To do that we built a set of campaign videos, social media posts, and an email campaign.",
            "challenge": "The broad donor and support base for IPPNWC was cultivated during the peak of the peace movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, young people have shifted their focus to other global issues like climate change and social inequality. The challenge for us was to bring a modern twist to the peace movement that would resonate with, and mobilize, young activists (specifically medical students).",
            "dotstrip": "Find a vital 21st century message for the peace movement and IPPNWC.",
            "approach": "At the time, COVID-19 was most of what people could think about. There wasn’t lot of space left for any other social issues—so we leaned into that. We focused on creating a video that likened the nuclear weapons crisis to the global health crisis that we had been in the midst of for more than a year at that point. We also pointed to the unprecedented capacity of global institutions to roll out effective solutions to both crises—in the case of COVID-19, the vaccine and in the case of nuclear weapons, non-proliferation treaties. Finally, we leveraged the elevated importance of health care workers’ opinions in the midst of a global pandemic to create a sense of moral authority in the messaging.",
            "execution": "To roll out this campaign strategy we built three videos, three social posts, and an email campaign with a focus on the messaging. The video was designed to make the audience think we were talking about COVID—and then reveal that we were, in fact, referring to was a global nuclear crisis. We did this to expose the parallels between the two crisis—and to invoke the active global response to COVID as proof that we needed a similarly forceful response to nuclear proliferation. Our email campaign used similar messaging point—but when on to discuss the hope that exists in the movement. We pointed to a history of successful activism and the passion of youth to show our audience the light at the end of the tunnel.",
            "outcome": "When surveyed, 92% of medical students said that they would be highly likely to share the campaigns flagship video with their peers—and seek out further information on the subject. Qualitatively, medical students pointed to the novelty of the campaign and the important role that it played putting the issue on their radar. In the end, the campaign was successful in driving new interest among medical students to IPPNWC’s Fellowships and programs."

            "challenge": "People with chronic pain, and people who have been left behind by the modern medical system, often don’t trust care providers. We needed to built a brand that would help those people feel comfortable and seen—while communicating the fact that the organization’s founder is a credentialed (and innovative) leader in the field.",

            "approach": "We started with in depth interviews—looking over the founder’s experience and research about people who have faced barriers to care. We took this information to develop our brand strategy. This took the form of Experience Principles—which defined the brand’s audience and cardinal rules for the brand. Once that was done, we worked to develop a visual brand and website that reflected our strategic objectives. Finally, with all of this research and brand strategy done—we developed a brand Go-To-Market campaign which went out through social media and digital advertising.",
            "execution": "We wanted to build a Psystem world—a digital experience that would make the user feel safe through every touchpoint + interaction with Psystem. That started with the visual brand, and really came to life with the website. The story of a backpacker journeying through life became a core motif. This motif was then implemented and expanded upon through every touchpoint. By the time we had finished our work with Psystem we had built a veritable Wonderland that Alice would be impressed by (and feel at ease in).",
            "outcome": "Psystem has a consistent world that has come through every relevant touch point. The Experience Principles and broader brand strategy has been extremely well implemented within the organization. The current marketing team had done a great job of independently sticking to, and thoughtfully expanding on, the brand that we handed them. Since our initial work with Psystem, they’ve grown from a single entrepreneur to a 7 person team within a year."

They approached us for a brand refresh, website redesign, and brand activation campaign.",

This meant focusing on building community partnerships, donor relationships, and strengthening their board of directors. They needed a brand and campaign that would help them do all of that.",

            "approach": "We looked at a mix of successful anti-poverty charities and period product brands—to find a balance that would speak to audiences young and old (those in need of support and donors). From there, we built a website and campaign that reflected the direction that we discovered in our work. The campaign was #CallItWhatItIs. We asked young women from around the world what they had called their period, instead of period. We knew that there were bound to be a ton of euphemisms used to hide discussions about periods.",
            "execution": "We executed the brand, website, and campaign.",
            "outcome": "During our work with Help A Girl Out (in the month that we worked with them)—they saw a 66% increase in organic reach and a 58% increase in average engagement with their posts. During and since the launch they’ve had major press coverage and the campaign was been shared by Canadian influencers like Olympian."
